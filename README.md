# Dave's Meals ( _Food-Order-App_ )

### Overview 
_Dave's Meals_ is a food-ordering app that would give GrubHub and Doordash a run for their money. It's a pure React project I created while learning React through _Udemy: "React - The Complete Guide"_.

### Technologies
* React ( _JavaScript_ )
  * Hooks ( _useState, useContext, useReducer, useRef_ )
  * React Portals 
* OOP fundamentals:
  * Inheritance
  * Re-usable components

### How to Run
This app is not deployed to my EC2. To run it, follow these steps:
* Git clone this repository into a local directory (folder)
* Open the folder in a modern IDE (_VS Code preferably_)
* Run _npm start_ from the terminal window

### Lessons Learned
 This project was built with the assistance of a tutorial through Udemy that taught the _React framework_ ( 48+ hours ). Note that the data is "dummy data" since this portion of the _Udemy Course_ didn't span _implementing Databases_ yet.
